            <p><strong><em>AcaWriter</em></strong> provides automated feedback on academic writing. Research shows many students find it tough to express their ideas in formal academic language, and would benefit from faster, more actionable feedback.</p>
            <p><strong><em>AcaWriter</em></strong> works by looking for hallmarks of good academic writing that signal (to your audience) that youâ€™re developing ideas. This helps demonstrate your critical thinking, your ability to put forward an argument, and your development as a reflective professional.</p>
            <p><strong><em>AcaWriter</em></strong> gives you feedback to help you improve your draft. Nobody will see your documents other than you and the UTS team developing the tool. We encourage you to revise your draft and get feedback as many times as you want. REMEMBER, AcaWriter is not grading your work!</p>
